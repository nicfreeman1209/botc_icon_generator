To use:

- place your black and white `.png` masks into `./masks/red` `./masks/blue` and `./masks/traveler`
- run `generate.py`
- pick your files out from `./generated`

Masks should be png files, black on a white background. It doesn't matter what size/shape they are. The script will locate the non-white region of the mask and use only that. 

Repo contains example masks + generated icons from the homebrew All Hat And No Cattle
